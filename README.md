# grocery-list

 Chantal still uses a pen and paper for our grocery list. Between forgetting to add items and forgetting the list all together.
 Creating this app was a perfect oppertunity to learn a new framework(s), vue.js, waveui, axios, Sequelize, express and node.js and solve a problem. 

# Built with
    Frontend: Vue3.3 Composition API, Axios, hosted in AWS S3
    Backend: Node.js, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, secure RESTful API hosted in AWS EB
